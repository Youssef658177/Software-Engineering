## How to use this roadmap

1. Start from **Foundations** and follow down the list.  
2. Use the visual roadmap (`images/your-original-roadmap.png`) as a guide; use this README for links & structure.  
3. Track progress by forking the repo and marking completed items.  
4. Combine academic courses with practical projects â€” build a portfolio as you learn.
