## Summary

This README pairs the visual roadmap (image above) with a **textual curriculum**.  
Each topic below lists high-quality resources (courses, books, curricula) from Coursera, edX, MIT OCW, IBM Skills, Khan Academy, freeCodeCamp, OSSU, TeachYourselfCS, InfoCobuild and top universities — with a short description explaining why to pick that resource.

(OSSU is used as a structural inspiration and as one of the recommended full curricula). 0

## How to use this roadmap

1. Start from **Foundations** and work upward to **Advanced Topics**.  
2. For each box/topic in the image, use the matching textual links below (each link has a short description).  
3. Track progress by forking this repo and checking items as you complete them.  
4. Use OSSU or TeachYourselfCS tracks for a full, ordered program; use Coursera/edX/MIT courses to swap-in preferred lectures. 1
